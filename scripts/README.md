## Move Environments
Allows a user to move environment(s) from one project to another.
It archives (marks inactive) the original environment. 
It reads the configuration and sets up the variables in the same exact manner.
And creates a new environment with the same exact configuration.

Note: FYI, this script cannot migrate your deployment history; it will be archived with the original environment.
