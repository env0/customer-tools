# env0 Workflow exmaple using Terragrunt templates.

This example will build out a AWS VPC and Subnet in 2 stages.  The VPC folder contains the code to create the VPC and the subnet folder contains the code to provision a single subnet.

Typically when using Terragrunt, dependancies need to be created.  However with env0 you can run both sets of code in a specific order.

The way this is accomplished is by using an env0.workflow.yml file which can be found in the root directory.

## How to use this code.

- Create a Terragrunt template call "customer-example-vpc".
- Set the VCS values to the following:
- - Repository URL = https://github.com/env0/customer-tools
- - Branch = main
- - Folder = examples/terragrunt/workflows/vpc/

- Create a Terragunt template call "customer-example-subnets".
- Set the VCS values to the following:
- - Repository URL = https://github.com/env0/customer-tools
- - Branch = main
- - Folder = examples/terragrunt/workflows/subnets/

- Create a Workflow template call "customer-example-workflow (vpc & subnet)".
- Set the VCS values to the following:
- - Repository URL = https://github.com/env0/customer-tools
- - Branch = main
- - Folder = examples/terragrunt/workflows/

Run the "customer-example-workflow (vpc & subnet)" template.
